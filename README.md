# Angular Swiper

Since ionic V1 lists doesn't support swipes for both sides i wrote this simple wrappers for Swiper (which seems to be the one used in ionic 2) to support this.

## Demo

A prototype demo is avaliable [here](https://codepen.io/Grohden/pen/EbjWBe) and on the demo folder

## Notes

Swiper is a **SLIDE** lib, so there are some limitations in this lib..

There are some problems with ionic list scroll **on browser mode**, it seems that swiper take the 'drag'/scroll event to itself.
